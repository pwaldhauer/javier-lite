# javier-lite

Very short script to convert a Wordpress Export (wrx) to static files, including downloading images. It's not very
smart, it only downloads images referenced in `img`-tags, so if your blog used something else, e.g. custom shortcodes,
it will not work. But feel free to just change the code to fit your needs!

See the first lines for configuration.
